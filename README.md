# Modern Design System Starter

Starter kit for building a modern, modular, React design system.

## Uses

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for building components.
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for styles and theming.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for developing components and [Storybook Docs](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/docs) for documentation.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting.
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile js.
- [Jest](https://babeljs.io/) for testing.

## Install

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is the default package manager, but you can use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) if you want. It's recommended that you don't mix the two though as it can cause problems. It's also recommended that you delete the yarn.lock file before run NPM install.

## Scripts

- `build` - uses Babel to compile source code to a browser-friendly code.
- `storybook` - launches Storybook development environment.
- `test` - runs Jest testing.

## Testing

Test components by creating a .test.js file alongside the Javascript file.
